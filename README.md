### Description

This assignment was used to test our knowledge in Javascript. Our goal is to make a password generator that can use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. In order to utilize what I've learned so far, I used prompts, event listeners, if else statements, and a few methods learned through independent study. Given that this was an "odd" week we started this project with our HTML page and a few lines of Javascript pre-written. Using what was learned in class and revisiting the activities proved to be very useful. I also visited MDN frequently.
