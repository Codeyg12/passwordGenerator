# Password Generator Starter Code

This assignment was used to test our knowledge in Javascript. Our goal is to make a password generator that can use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. In order to utilize what I've learned so far, I used prompts, event listeners, if else statements, and a few methods learned through independent study. Given that this was an "odd" week we started this project with our HTML page and a few lines of Javascript pre-written. Using what was learned in class and revisiting the activities proved to be very useful. I also visited MDN frequently.

## Guidelines

Our acceptance criteria included

1. A prompt for the user to select between 8-128 characters
2. If no selection was made an alert would appear or if too few or too many characters were requested
3. Four prompts following to confirm choices of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols
4. An alert would appear if no choices were made
5. The newly generated password appears in the textbox or an alert

### Overall

This project was fairly challenging but a lot of fun. I know it needs a little bit of touch-up however I'm pleased with how it's turned out so far. I hope to learn more and improve continuously. I also found beautifytools.com/javascript-validator which was extremely helpful
